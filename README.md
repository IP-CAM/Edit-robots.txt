# Edit-robots.txt


## Robot.txt Editor - a module for editing robots.txt in Opencart (ocStore) right from the admin area.



If the file does not exist (as on the original Opencart for example), it will create it. If necessary, you can fill in the data from the robots.txt file of the ocStore assembly of the corresponding version.

Installed in modules, does not require vQmod, does not overwrite any files.
